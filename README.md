# Skincare Tracker

A management system designed to keep track of a user's inventory of skincare and cosmetic products and notify the user, when an item is nearing expiration and when an item has expired. The system allows users to edit and delete products from their inventory tracker and allows users to toggle the repurchase option for their favourite products. The management system also allows users to search and look up an item through their inventory list. Users are able create a wishlist of products as well. Check out the [live demo](https://skincare-tracker.vercel.app/) hosted on Vercel!
